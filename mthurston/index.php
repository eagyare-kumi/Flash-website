			<h2>About Me</h2>

			<p>I am an ex-student at the University of Rochester. They kicked me out (I graduated), but I’m still here, auditing courses for the fall. I’m taking Environmental Economics, Environmental Law and Policy, and Web Design. Why? Because I think they’ll be useful if I do anything sustainability-related in my career. And because it buys me more time to figure out what I want to do with my life. I don’t know what will happen after this fall… I guess sooner or later I need to decide what I’m going to do, at least to start out in a career.</p>
