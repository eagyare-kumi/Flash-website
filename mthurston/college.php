			<h2>College</h2>

			<p>College was the first time that I could choose pretty much all of what I wanted to study, and I loved that. Every semester I spent hours and hours looking at the course catalogs, emailing professors for syllabi, sitting in on way more courses than I was going to take, and trying to make decisions (which I’m bad at). I didn’t declare my major until fall of my junior year, when I created my own major (so I never really decided anyway). Although the library has been my second home, I’ve also been pretty involved in a couple clubs (Students for a Democratic Society, Greenspace, and Partners in Reading especially), and kept up violin for the first three years.</p>
