			<h2>Early Life</h2>

			<p>I was born in Boston, MA, but I’ve lived in Rochester, NY since I was 6. I remember a lot from Boston: riding the subways with my brother and dad, going to school, kids’ soccer leagues, babysitters, family friends, playgrounds, and much more. The beginning of Harry Potter is set in my first house, because that’s where my babysitter read it to me. And of course I remember my family – my mom, dad, and older brother – but they came with me to Rochester.</p>
