			<h2>School Years</h2>

			<p>In elementary school I was a pretty busy kid. Both my parents worked full time, so after school I went to an after-school program until about 6pm. Then, most nights we’d come home for a rushed dinner and then drive off again for some activity: soccer, gymnastics, basketball, swimming, violin lessons, violin classes, or my brother’s baseball games. In the summer and during school breaks my brother and I went to camps: music camps, gymnastics camp, sports camp, chess camp, “fun camp” (or “boring camp” as my brother called it), and others. But what I did more than anything was read.</p>

			<p>In middle school and high school I didn’t do sports, but I filled my time with homework and violin, and school clubs to some extent. I was a very… slow… worker… so I spent a lot of time doing homework. I also did more orchestras, violin group classes, and started practicing violin a little more seriously (sometimes), so that took more time too. My favorite thing from high school was being in a classical music improvisation group, with some of my best friends.</p>
