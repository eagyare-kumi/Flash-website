		<p>Colonie, New York raised in a tight knit family. 18 months old I was diagnosed with being profoundly deaf. I am one of six people that are Deaf within my family. My maternal grandparents, as well as my mother and younger sister. I was always ambitous from the start and when I was young I wanted to be a rock star. Growing up in a strict household made us a really tight knit family between cousins. I graduated high school in 2010 and started school at RIT. Dropped out, worked for four long grueling years and realized I wanted to do more. Travelled around the United States, came back and went back to school. Thats where she began her journey into the digital media world.</p>
