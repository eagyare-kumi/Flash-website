				<p>I was born in England to a Nigerian mother and Ghanaian father, we moved to Ghana when I was 8 years old. By this time, I had already developed a strong love for science and medicine; something which was very easy to fuel among the pre-professional fever of Ghana’s middle class. I studied physics, biology and chemistry (Chemistry was my favorite), and even tried Additional mathematics before realising that I would crumble and die if I left myself with no creative outlet.</p>

				<p>So I continued to take music classes and to play piano. I was a good student, but my interest in the sciences seldom extended beyond the classroom. All of my extracurriculars were centered around people and the arts: I was the student body vice president, I fundraised for charities and visited small children and hospitals with donations and gifts. I also acted as the Editor-in-Chief for my school’s annual magazine, and organised our 10th anniversary literary and cultural night. These things made me feel alive; but for some reason, my love for them never tore my attention away from the ultimate goal: to be the very first doctor in my family.</p>
